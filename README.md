# GenAIExperiment_AGILECLASS
Gen AI experiment for CS 394 Agile

Does the code work? If not, what's broken.

It works but just inputs the wrong information

How is the code better than what the team currently has?

Its not at all. Our current code works pretty well

How is the code worse?

The logic is not as accurate

How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

A couple times, not too difficult to get it running 

Overall impression of the experience

I think this was a cool experiment to compare gpt 3.5 coding capabilities with that of 5-6 CS students over a couple weeks. We definately won which is a good sign for the good guys :)
